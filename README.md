## 🎯 Overview

KhoopDefi is a decentralized reward distribution system that operates on a strict **First-In-First-Out (FIFO)** queue model. Users purchase entries, and each entry progresses through 4 cycles, earning payouts along the way.

### Key Features
- ✅ **Fair Distribution**: Strict FIFO queue - first in gets paid first
- ✅ **Automated Processing**: Cycles process automatically when balance is available
- ✅ **Referral Rewards**: Active referrers earn bonuses (with inactivity tracking)
- ✅ **Transparent**: All distributions tracked on-chain
- ✅ **Scalable**: Handles unlimited users and entries with optimized gas usage
- ✅ **Self-Registration Only**: Users must register themselves (no third-party registration)

## 💰 How It Works

### Entry Purchase
- **Cost per Entry**: $15 USDT
- **Maximum Cycles per Entry**: 4 cycles
- **Payout per Cycle**: $5 USDT
- **Total Return per Entry**: $20 USDT (4 cycles × $5)
- **Net Profit per Entry**: $5 USDT ($20 earned - $15 invested)

### The Cycle Journey
```
User Buys Entry ($15) 
    ↓
Entry Enters Queue
    ↓
Cycle 1 → User Earns $5 (Referrer & Team get paid)
    ↓
Cycle 2 → User Earns $5 (Referrer & Team get paid)
    ↓
Cycle 3 → User Earns $5 (Referrer & Team get paid)
    ↓
Cycle 4 → User Earns $5 (NO referrer/team bonus - final cycle)
    ↓
Entry Complete (Total: $20 earned, $5 profit)
```

## 💸 Money Flow Breakdown

### When You Buy 1 Entry ($15 USDT)

Your $15 goes into the contract and stays there to fund future cycles. Here's what happens:

#### Initial Purchase Distribution

**At Purchase Time (Payment 1/4)**:
- **Your Referrer**: $1 USDT (if they are ACTIVE)
- **Team Distribution**: $1 USDT (distributed to project stakeholders)
- **Missed Tracking**: If referrer is inactive, $1 is tracked as "missed earnings"

#### Per Cycle Distribution (Cycles 1, 2, 3 only)

**When YOUR Entry Completes Cycles 1-3:**
- **Your Payout**: $5 USDT (goes to you)
- **Your Referrer Bonus**: $1 USDT (if your referrer is ACTIVE, else tracked as missed)
- **Team Distribution**: $1 USDT (distributed to project stakeholders)

**Cycle 4 is Different:**
- **Your Payout**: $5 USDT (goes to you)
- **NO Referrer Bonus**: Cycle 4 does not pay referral bonuses
- **NO Team Distribution**: Cycle 4 does not pay team shares

### Complete Payment Schedule

**Per Entry Total (Purchase + 4 Cycles)**:

| Event | User Payout | Referrer Bonus | Team Share | Total |
|-------|-------------|----------------|------------|-------|
| Purchase | $0 | $1* | $1 | $2 |
| Cycle 1 | $5 | $1* | $1 | $7 |
| Cycle 2 | $5 | $1* | $1 | $7 |
| Cycle 3 | $5 | $1* | $1 | $7 |
| Cycle 4 | $5 | $0 | $0 | $5 |
| **Total** | **$20** | **$4*** | **$4** | **$28** |

\* Only paid if referrer is ACTIVE, otherwise tracked as missed earnings

### Team Distribution Breakdown ($1 per payment event)

Every qualifying event (purchase + cycles 1-3) distributes $1 to the project team:

| Recipient | Amount | Count | Total per Event |
|-----------|--------|-------|-----------------|
| Core Team Wallets | $0.15 each | 4 wallets | $0.60 |
| Investor Wallets | $0.02 each | 15 wallets | $0.30 |
| Reserve Wallet | $0.10 | 1 wallet | $0.10 |
| **Total** | | | **$1.00** |

**Total Team Earnings per Entry**: $4 (purchase + 3 cycles)

## 👥 User Journey & Earnings

### Registration Requirements

**NEW: Self-Registration Only**
- Users MUST register themselves by calling `registerUser(userAddress, referrerAddress)`
- The `userAddress` parameter MUST equal `msg.sender`
- Third parties cannot register users on their behalf
- This prevents unauthorized registration and ensures user consent

### Active vs Inactive Status

**Active User**:
- Has at least one entry with remaining cycles
- Earns referral bonuses when their referrals purchase entries or complete cycles
- Status automatically updates as entries complete

**Inactive User**:
- Has no entries OR all entries have completed 4 cycles
- Does NOT earn referral bonuses
- Referral bonuses are tracked as "missed earnings"
- Can become active again by purchasing new entries

### Scenario: You Buy 10 Entries

**Your Investment**: $150 (10 entries × $15)

**Your Maximum Earnings**: $200 (10 entries × 4 cycles × $5)

**Your Net Profit**: $50 ($200 - $150)

**ROI**: 33.3% ($50 profit / $150 investment)

### If You Have Active Referrals

Let's say you referred 5 users, and they each bought 10 entries:

**Referral Bonus Calculation** (assuming you stay active):
- Each referral entry: 1 purchase + 3 cycles = 4 payment events
- You earn $1 per event (if active)
- Total referral entries: 5 users × 10 entries = 50 entries
- Total payment events: 50 entries × 4 events = 200 events
- **Your Referral Earnings**: 200 events × $1 = **$200 USDT**

**Your Total Earnings**:
- Personal cycles: $200
- Referral bonuses: $200
- **Total**: $400 USDT
- **Net Profit**: $250 USDT ($400 - $150 investment)
- **ROI**: 166.7%

**⚠️ Important**: If you become inactive (all entries complete), you stop earning referral bonuses. Your missed earnings are tracked but not paid.

## 📊 Project Economics

### System Requirements

For the system to function smoothly, the contract needs sufficient balance to process cycles.

**Balance Required per Cycle**:
- **Cycles 1-3**: $7 USDT ($5 user + $1 referrer + $1 team)
- **Cycle 4**: $5 USDT ($5 user only)

**Balance Required per Purchase**: $2 USDT ($1 referrer + $1 team)

### Contract Balance Management

The contract balance fluctuates based on:

**Balance Increases** ⬆️
- User entry purchases ($15 per entry)
- Cooldown reduction fees ($0.50)
- System donations

**Balance Decreases** ⬇️
- Cycle payouts ($5 per cycle)
- Referral bonuses ($1 per event for cycles 1-3 and purchase)
- Team distributions ($1 per event for cycles 1-3 and purchase)

### Automatic Processing

The system automatically processes cycles whenever:
1. Contract balance is sufficient
2. Eligible entries exist in queue (not maxed out)
3. Gas is available

**Automatic triggers**:
- Entry purchases (with optimized gas limits)
- Manual `completeCycles()` call
- Manual `processCyclesBatch(iterations)` call with custom iteration count

---

## 🔄 Cycle Processing Logic

### Optimized Gas-Conscious Processing

KhoopDefi uses an intelligent, gas-optimized queue system that ensures fairness while preventing out-of-gas errors.

#### Gas Safety Features

**Three-Layer Protection**:
1. **Gas Buffer**: Reserves 120,000 gas to prevent OOG errors
2. **Per-Iteration Limit**: Maximum 700,000 gas per cycle iteration
3. **Max Iterations**: Caps at 50 iterations per automatic call

**Calculation**:
```
maxIterations = min(
    (startGas - GAS_BUFFER) / MAX_GAS_PER_ITERATION,
    MAX_ITERATIONS_PER_CALL
)
```

#### How It Works

1. **Queue Order**: All entries are processed in the exact order they were purchased
2. **One Cycle per Round**: Each entry receives only ONE cycle per complete queue loop
3. **Gas-Aware**: Stops processing before running out of gas
4. **Exit Conditions**:
   - Contract balance insufficient
   - Gas limit reached
   - No eligible entries remain (all maxed out)

#### Processing Flow

```
Calculate Safe Iterations
    ↓
Round 1: Process up to maxIterations entries (1 cycle each)
    ↓
Check: Balance sufficient AND gas available?
    ↓ YES
Round 2: Process next batch of entries (1 cycle each)
    ↓
Continue until: Balance insufficient OR gas low OR all entries maxed out
```

### Manual Batch Processing

For fine-grained control, use the manual batch function:

```solidity
function processCyclesBatch(uint256 iterations) external nonReentrant returns (uint256)
```

**Use Cases**:
- Process specific number of cycles
- Distribute gas usage across multiple transactions
- Test cycle processing
- Clear queue in controlled manner

**Example**:
```javascript
// Process exactly 100 cycles
await contract.processCyclesBatch(100);

// Process maximum safe amount automatically
await contract.completeCycles();
```

### Example: 4 Users, 10 Entries Each

**Initial State**:
- 40 total entries in queue
- Each needs 4 cycles
- Total cycles needed: 160

**Processing**:
- **Round 1**: Process up to 50 entries → 40 entries get cycle 1
- **Round 2**: Process up to 50 entries → 40 entries get cycle 2
- **Round 3**: Process up to 50 entries → 40 entries get cycle 3
- **Round 4**: Process up to 50 entries → 40 entries get cycle 4

**Result**: All entries complete in 4 automatic rounds (or fewer if gas allows)!

## 🆕 Key Updates & Changes

### Recent Contract Improvements

#### 1. **Self-Registration Enforcement**
```solidity
function registerUser(address user, address referrer) external {
    if (user != msg.sender) revert KhoopDefi__CannotRegisterForAnotherUser();
    // ... rest of registration logic
}
```
- Prevents unauthorized third-party registration
- Ensures user consent and prevents abuse
- User parameter must match msg.sender

#### 2. **Referrer Activity Check at Purchase**
```solidity
bool isReferrerActive = (userReferrer != address(0)) && users[userReferrer].isActive;
```
- Checks referrer status once at purchase time
- More efficient than checking in loop
- Tracks missed earnings if referrer inactive

#### 3. **Gas-Optimized Cycle Processing**
```solidity
uint256 maxIterations = (startGas - GAS_BUFFER) / MAX_GAS_PER_ITERATION;
if (maxIterations > MAX_ITERATIONS_PER_CALL) {
    maxIterations = MAX_ITERATIONS_PER_CALL;
}
```
- Dynamic gas calculation
- Prevents out-of-gas errors
- Processes maximum safe cycles per call

#### 4. **Cooldown Fee Tracking**
```solidity
uint256 private accumulatedCoolDownFee;

function reduceCooldown() external nonReentrant {
    // ... validation
    accumulatedCoolDownFee += COOLDOWN_FEE;
    // ... cooldown logic
}
```
- Tracks total cooldown fees collected
- Transparent fee accumulation
- View function: `getAccumulatedCoolDownFee()`

#### 5. **Manual Batch Processing**
- New function: `processCyclesBatch(iterations)`
- Allows custom iteration counts
- Useful for gas management and testing

#### 6. **Additional View Functions**
- `getQueueLength()`: Total entries in queue
- `getAccumulatedCoolDownFee()`: Total cooldown fees collected
- Better visibility into system state

## 🧪 Real Test Results

### Test Scenario: 4 Users × 10 Entries

We ran a comprehensive test with 4 users each purchasing 10 entries in sequence.

#### Setup
- **Initial Contract Balance**: 3,000 USDT (seeded for testing)
- **User 1** (PowerCycle): Purchased 10 entries
- **User 2**: Purchased 10 entries (referred by User 1)
- **User 3**: Purchased 10 entries (referred by User 1)
- **User 4**: Purchased 10 entries (referred by User 1)

#### Individual Results

| User | Entries | Total Cycles | Earnings | Referral Bonus | Missed Earnings | Status |
|------|---------|--------------|----------|----------------|-----------------|--------|
| User 1 | 10 | 40 (Complete) | $200 | $120* | $0 | All maxed out |
| User 2 | 10 | 40 (Complete) | $200 | $0 | $0 | All maxed out |
| User 3 | 10 | 40 (Complete) | $200 | $0 | $0 | All maxed out |
| User 4 | 10 | 40 (Complete) | $200 | $0 | $0 | All maxed out |

\* User 1 earns: $1 per entry × 30 entries × 4 events = $120 (purchase + 3 cycles, not cycle 4)

#### Payment Breakdown for User 1's Referral Earnings

**Per Referral Entry (30 referral entries total)**:
- Purchase: $1
- Cycle 1: $1
- Cycle 2: $1
- Cycle 3: $1
- Cycle 4: $0 (no bonus on final cycle)
- **Total per entry**: $4

**User 1's Referral Income**: 30 entries × $4 = $120

#### Global Statistics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Users | 5 (including PowerCycle) |
| Total Active Users | 0 (all completed) |
| Total Entries Purchased | 40 |
| Total Cycles Completed | 160 |
| Total Payouts Made | $800 |
| Total Referral Bonuses Paid | $120 |
| Total Referral Bonuses Missed | $0 |
| Total Team Earnings | $160 |
| Cooldown Fees Collected | $0 |
| Final Contract Balance | ~$2,440 |

#### Money Flow Analysis

**Total Money In**:
- Entry purchases: 40 entries × $15 = $600
- Pre-seeded balance: $3,000
- **Total Available**: $3,600

**Total Money Out**:
- User payouts: 160 cycles × $5 = $800
- Referral bonuses: 30 entries × 4 events × $1 = $120
- Team distributions: 40 entries × 4 events × $1 = $160
- **Total Distributed**: $1,080

**Expected Balance**: $3,600 - $1,080 = **$2,520**
**Actual Balance**: ~$2,440-$2,520 (depending on gas costs)

#### Key Observations

1. ✅ **All Entries Completed**: Every single entry (40 total) completed all 4 cycles
2. ✅ **Cycle 4 Correctly Excludes Bonuses**: No referral/team bonuses paid on cycle 4
3. ✅ **Automatic Processing**: No manual intervention needed - system processed all 160 cycles
4. ✅ **Fair Distribution**: Each entry received exactly 4 cycles
5. ✅ **Referral System Works**: Active referrer (User 1) received bonuses correctly
6. ✅ **No Missed Earnings**: All referrals were active, so no bonuses were missed
7. ✅ **Team Distributions Accurate**: Project received $1 per qualifying event
8. ✅ **Gas Optimization Works**: Processing completed without OOG errors
