## üéØ Overview

KhoopDefi is a decentralized reward distribution system that operates on a strict **First-In-First-Out (FIFO)** queue model. Users purchase entries, and each entry progresses through 4 cycles, earning payouts along the way.

### Key Features
- ‚úÖ **Fair Distribution**: Strict FIFO queue - first in gets paid first
- ‚úÖ **Automated Processing**: Cycles process automatically when balance is available
- ‚úÖ **Referral Rewards**: Active referrers earn on every cycle
- ‚úÖ **Transparent**: All distributions tracked on-chain
- ‚úÖ **Scalable**: Handles unlimited users and entries

---

## üí∞ How It Works

### Entry Purchase
- **Cost per Entry**: $15 USDT
- **Maximum Cycles per Entry**: 4 cycles
- **Payout per Cycle**: $5 USDT
- **Total Return per Entry**: $20 USDT (4 cycles √ó $5)
- **Net Profit per Entry**: $5 USDT ($20 earned - $15 invested)

### The Cycle Journey
```
User Buys Entry ($15) 
    ‚Üì
Entry Enters Queue
    ‚Üì
Cycle 1 ‚Üí User Earns $5
    ‚Üì
Cycle 2 ‚Üí User Earns $5
    ‚Üì
Cycle 3 ‚Üí User Earns $5
    ‚Üì
Cycle 4 ‚Üí User Earns $5

## üí∏ Money Flow Breakdown

### When You Buy 1 Entry ($15 USDT)

Your $15 goes into the contract and stays there to fund future cycles. Here's what happens:

#### Per Cycle Distribution (Happens 4 times per entry)

**When YOUR Entry Gets a Cycle:**
- **Your Payout**: $5 USDT (goes to you)
- **Your Referrer Bonus**: $1 USDT (if your referrer is active)
- **Team Distribution**: $1 USDT (distributed to project stakeholders)

**Total Cost per Cycle**: $7 USDT
- $5 ‚Üí User
- $1 ‚Üí Active Referrer
- $1 ‚Üí Team

**Total Needed for Your Entry to Complete**: $28 USDT
- ($7 per cycle √ó 4 cycles)

### Team Distribution Breakdown ($1 per cycle)

Every cycle that processes distributes $1 to the project team:

| Recipient | Amount | Count | Total per Cycle |
|-----------|--------|-------|-----------------|
| Core Team Wallets | $0.15 each | 4 wallets | $0.60 |
| Investor Wallets | $0.02 each | 15 wallets | $0.30 |
| Reserve Wallet | $0.10 | 1 wallet | $0.10 |
| **Total** | | | **$1.00** |

## üë• User Journey & Earnings

### Scenario: You Buy 10 Entries

**Your Investment**: $150 (10 entries √ó $15)

**Your Maximum Earnings**: $200 (10 entries √ó 4 cycles √ó $5)

**Your Net Profit**: $50 ($200 - $150)

**ROI**: 33.3% ($50 profit / $150 investment)

### If You Have Active Referrals

Let's say you referred 5 users, and they each bought 10 entries:

**Referral Bonus Calculation**:
- Each referral entry completes 4 cycles
- You earn $1 per cycle (if you're active)
- Total referral entries: 5 users √ó 10 entries = 50 entries
- Total cycles: 50 entries √ó 4 cycles = 200 cycles
- **Your Referral Earnings**: 200 cycles √ó $1 = **$200 USDT**

**Your Total Earnings**:
- Personal cycles: $200
- Referral bonuses: $200
- **Total**: $400 USDT
- **Net Profit**: $250 USDT ($400 - $150 investment)
- **ROI**: 166.7%

## üìä Project Economics

### System Requirements

For the system to function smoothly, the contract needs sufficient balance to process cycles.

**Balance Required per Cycle**: $7 USDT
- $5 user payout
- $1 referral bonus (if applicable)
- $1 team distribution

### Contract Balance Management

The contract balance fluctuates based on:

**Balance Increases** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è
- User entry purchases ($15 per entry)
- Cooldown reduction fees ($0.50)
- System donations

**Balance Decreases** ‚¨áÔ∏è
- Cycle payouts ($5 per cycle)
- Referral bonuses ($1 per cycle, if active referrer)
- Team distributions ($1 per cycle)

### Automatic Processing

The system automatically processes cycles whenever:
1. Contract balance ‚â• $7 USDT
2. Eligible entries exist in queue (not maxed out)
3. Gas is available

**No manual intervention needed!** The contract processes cycles on:
- Entry purchases
- Cooldown reductions
- System donations
- Manual `completeCycles()` call

---

## üîÑ Cycle Processing Logic

### Hybrid Strict FIFO Model

KhoopDefi uses an intelligent queue system that ensures fairness while maximizing efficiency.

#### How It Works

1. **Queue Order**: All entries are processed in the exact order they were purchased
2. **One Cycle per Round**: Each entry receives only ONE cycle per complete queue loop
3. **Automatic Continuation**: After completing a full loop, if any cycles were processed, the system automatically starts another round
4. **Exit Condition**: Processing stops when:
   - Contract balance < $7 USDT, OR
   - No eligible entries remain (all maxed out), OR
   - Gas limit reached

#### Processing Flow

```
Round 1: Process all eligible entries (1 cycle each)
    ‚Üì
Check balance ‚â• $7?
    ‚Üì YES
Round 2: Process all eligible entries (1 cycle each)
    ‚Üì
Check balance ‚â• $7?
    ‚Üì YES
Round 3: Continue...
    ‚Üì
Until: Balance < $7 or all entries maxed out
```

### Example: 4 Users, 10 Entries Each

**Initial State**:
- 40 total entries in queue
- Each needs 4 cycles
- Total cycles needed: 160

**Processing**:
- **Round 1**: All 40 entries get cycle 1 (40 cycles processed)
- **Round 2**: All 40 entries get cycle 2 (40 cycles processed)
- **Round 3**: All 40 entries get cycle 3 (40 cycles processed)
- **Round 4**: All 40 entries get cycle 4 (40 cycles processed)

**Result**: All entries complete in 4 automatic rounds!

### Why User 1 Finishes First

This is **expected behavior** due to FIFO:

- User 1 bought entries first ‚Üí entries 1-10
- User 2 bought entries second ‚Üí entries 11-20
- User 3 bought entries third ‚Üí entries 21-30
- User 4 bought entries fourth ‚Üí entries 31-40

**Queue Position Matters**:
- If balance runs low mid-round, earlier entries (User 1) get processed first
- If new purchases happen, they process existing queue before new entries
- Everyone gets 1 cycle per round, but User 1's entries are always ahead in line

## üß™ Real Test Results

### Test Scenario: 4 Users √ó 10 Entries

We ran a comprehensive test with 4 users each purchasing 10 entries in sequence.

#### Setup
- **Initial Contract Balance**: 3,000 USDT (seeded for testing)
- **User 1**: Purchased 10 entries
- **User 2**: Purchased 10 entries  
- **User 3**: Purchased 10 entries
- **User 4**: Purchased 10 entries

#### Individual Results

| User | Entries | Total Cycles | Earnings | Referral Bonus | Status |
|------|---------|--------------|----------|----------------|--------|
| User 1 | 10 | 40 (Complete) | $200 | $160 | All maxed out |
| User 2 | 10 | 40 (Complete) | $200 | $0 | All maxed out |
| User 3 | 10 | 40 (Complete) | $200 | $0 | All maxed out |
| User 4 | 10 | 40 (Complete) | $200 | $0 | All maxed out |

**Note**: User 1 earned referral bonuses because Users 2, 3, and 4 were registered with User 1 (PowerCycle wallet) as their referrer.

#### Global Statistics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Users | 5 |
| Total Active Users | 5 |
| Total Entries Purchased | 40 |
| Total Cycles Completed | 160 |
| Total Payouts Made | $800 |
| Total Referral Bonuses | $160 |
| Total Team Earnings | $160 |
| Final Contract Balance | $2,480 |

#### Money Flow Analysis

**Total Money In**:
- Entry purchases: 40 entries √ó $15 = $600
- Pre-seeded balance: $3,000
- **Total Available**: $3,600

**Total Money Out**:
- User payouts: 160 cycles √ó $5 = $800
- Referral bonuses: 160 cycles √ó $1 = $160
- Team distributions: 160 cycles √ó $1 = $160
- **Total Distributed**: $1,120

**Remaining Balance**: $3,600 - $1,120 = **$2,480** ‚úÖ

#### Key Observations

1. **All Entries Completed**: Every single entry (40 total) completed all 4 cycles
2. **Automatic Processing**: No manual intervention needed - system processed all 160 cycles automatically
3. **Fair Distribution**: Each entry received exactly 4 cycles, no more, no less
4. **Referral System Works**: Active referrer (User 1) received $1 per cycle for their referrals
5. **Team Distributions**: Project received $1 per cycle ($160 total)
6. **Balance Remains**: $2,480 USDT stays in contract for future cycles

## üîß Advanced Features

### Cooldown System

**Default Cooldown**: 30 minutes between purchases

**Cooldown Reduction**:
- Cost: $0.50 USDT
- Reduces cooldown to: 15 minutes
- Automatically processes available cycles

### Manual Cycle Processing

While cycles process automatically, you can also trigger processing manually:

    uint256 processed = _processAvailableCycles();
    if (processed == 0) revert KhoopDefi__NoActiveCycles();
}
```

**Use Cases**:
- After making a donation
- To process accumulated balance
- For testing/verification

### System Donations

Anyone can donate USDT to help process pending cycles:

```solidity
function donateToSystem(uint256 amount) external nonReentrant
```

**Benefits**:
- Increases contract balance
- Automatically processes cycles
- Helps clear the queue faster
