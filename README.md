# Khoop DeFi - Automated Slot-Based Investment Platform

## Overview

Khoop DeFi is a decentralized investment platform built on blockchain technology that operates through an automated slot-based contribution system. Users purchase entries, join a queue, and receive guaranteed payouts through smart contract automation.

## üéØ Core Mechanics

### Investment Structure
- **Entry Cost**: $15 USDT per slot
- **Total Payout**: $20 USDT per completed slot
- **Profit**: $5 USDT (33.33% ROI)
- **Capital Return**: $15 USDT (100% capital recovery)

### Revenue Distribution Per Entry ($15 USDT)
```
$15 USDT Entry Breakdown:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ $11 USDT ‚Üí Queue Payouts (73.33%)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ $3 USDT  ‚Üí Buyback System (20%)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ $1 USDT  ‚Üí Team Operations (6.67%)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ $0.60 ‚Üí Core Team (4 wallets)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ $0.30 ‚Üí Investors (15 wallets)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ $0.10 ‚Üí Reserve Fund
```

## üîÑ How The System Works

### 1. Entry Purchase
Users buy slots that are queued in first-in-first-out (FIFO) order:
- Pay $15 USDT to purchase entry
- Get assigned unique entry ID and queue position
- Entry marked as "pending" until completion

### 2. Automatic Buyback System
The system uses accumulated funds to auto-complete cycles:
- **Accumulation**: $3 per entry goes to buyback pool
- **Trigger**: When pool reaches $10 USDT threshold
- **Action**: Automatically completes oldest pending entry
- **Frequency**: Every ~4 entries (4 √ó $3 = $12 > $10 threshold)

### 3. Cycle Completion
When your slot is selected for completion:
- **Capital Return**: $15 USDT (original investment)
- **Profit Payment**: $5 USDT (guaranteed profit)
- **Total Received**: $20 USDT
- **Entry Status**: Marked as "completed"

### 4. Referral System
Earn bonuses by bringing new users:
- **Bonus Amount**: $1 USDT per referred entry
- **Payment**: Immediate when referral purchases
- **Tracking**: Permanent referrer-referee relationship
- **No Limits**: Unlimited referral potential

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Smart Contract Features
- **Reentrancy Protection**: SafeERC20 and ReentrancyGuard
- **Access Control**: Ownable with admin functions
- **Pausable**: Emergency stop functionality
- **Queue Management**: Optimized pending entry tracking

### Security Measures
- **Daily Limits**: Maximum 50 entries per user per day
- **Transaction Limits**: Maximum 10 entries per transaction
- **Anti-Spam**: 10-minute minimum between purchases
- **Balance Validation**: Ensures sufficient funds before payouts
- **Referral Validation**: Prevents self-referral and invalid referrers

### Gas Optimization
- **Pending Start ID**: O(1) queue pointer instead of O(n) scanning
- **Batch Operations**: Multiple entries in single transaction
- **Efficient Storage**: Optimized struct packing

## üìä System Analytics

### User Statistics
```solidity
struct User {
    address refferer;           // Referrer address
    uint256 entriesPurchased;  // Total slots bought
    uint256 entriesFilled;     // Completed cycles count
    uint256 reffererBonusEarned; // Commission earned
    uint256 slotFillEarnings;  // Profits from completions
    uint256 totalReferrals;    // Direct referrals count
    uint256 lastEntryAt;       // Anti-spam timestamp
    uint256 dailyEntries;      // Daily purchase counter
    uint256 lastDailyReset;    // Daily reset timestamp
    bool isRegistered;         // Registration status
}
```

### Global Metrics
- **Total Users**: All registered participants
- **Total Entries Purchased**: All slots bought
- **Total Entries Completed**: All finished cycles
- **Total Referrer Bonuses**: All commissions paid
- **Total Slot Fill Earnings**: All profits distributed

## üí∞ Economic Model

### Sustainability Factors
1. **Continuous Growth**: New entries fund existing payouts
2. **Automatic Processing**: Buyback system ensures flow
3. **Fee Structure**: 6.67% covers operations and growth
4. **Reserve Fund**: 0.67% emergency buffer

### Profit Sources
- **Direct Investment**: 33.33% ROI per completed slot
- **Referral Income**: $1 per person referred
- **Compound Growth**: Reinvest profits for multiple slots
- **Network Effects**: Growing community increases velocity

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- USDT-compatible wallet (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, etc.)
- Minimum $15 USDT balance
- Referrer address (existing user)

### Step-by-Step Process
1. **Connect Wallet**: Link your Web3 wallet to the dApp
2. **Get Referred**: Obtain referrer address from existing user
3. **Purchase Entry**: Send $15 USDT to buy your first slot
4. **Track Progress**: Monitor your queue position
5. **Receive Payout**: Get $20 USDT when cycle completes
6. **Refer Others**: Share your address to earn bonuses

### Example Transaction Flow
```javascript
// Purchase entry
await contract.purchaseEntries(
    15000000,  // $15 USDT (6 decimals)
    1,         // Number of entries
    referrerAddress
);

// Check your stats
const userStats = await contract.users(yourAddress);
console.log("Entries purchased:", userStats.entriesPurchased);
console.log("Completed cycles:", userStats.entriesFilled);

// View pending entries
const pendingEntries = await contract.getUserPendingEntries(yourAddress);
```
