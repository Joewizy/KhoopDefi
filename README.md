## 🔄 How It Works

### 1️⃣ Getting Started
1. **Register** - Create your account with a simple registration
2. **Fund** - Deposit USDT into your wallet
3. **Refer** - Share your referral link immediately (no purchase needed)

### 2️⃣ Making Investments
- **Purchase Entries**: Buy 1-20 entries at $15 each (note: for each entry bought, there is a cooldown of 30 minutes even if you buy 1 entry/slot)
- **Cooldown Period**: 30 minutes between purchases
- **Fast-Track Option**: Reduce cooldown to 15 minutes for a $0.50 fee 

### 3️⃣ Earning Rewards
- **Cycle Payouts**: Earn $5 per cycle (4 cycles per entry)
- **Referral Bonuses**: $1 for every entry purchased by your referrals
- **Active Status**: Keep at least one active entry to earn referral rewards

### 4️⃣ Buyback System
- **Automatic Recycling**: $3 (20%) from each $15 entry is allocated to the buyback pool
- **Automatic Payouts**: When the pool reaches $10, it automatically pays out the next eligible entry
- **Cycle Completion**: Each $10 buyback completes one cycle for the oldest active entry
- **Sustained Growth**: This mechanism ensures continuous payouts and system longevity
- **Transparent Tracking**: All buyback transactions are recorded on-chain for full transparency

Example:
1. 4 users each buy 1 entry ($15) → $12 total in buyback pool
2. System automatically pays out $10 to complete a cycle
3. Remaining $2 stays in the pool for future payouts
4. Process repeats as more entries are purchased
